# Applies PCA to collect systematica differences between pause sites at 
# orthologous promoters.

## Get the 3' patterns at TSS.  Fiter for complete mappability.

## PCA. Filter for pause sites that don't change in quantity.

## Get pause sites whose PCA is significantly different across species.

## Quantify frequency of shifts.  Look at types of shifts.  

## Correlate shifts with specific patterns of TXN.
